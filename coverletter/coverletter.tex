\cvparagraph{About Me}
I am a passionate full-stacks data engineer who loves to learn new skills, redesign the ways to obtain them and show the world how you can solve problems with them and how you can effectively present the results to the committers. I own a genuine interest in information technologies advances, but this doesn't mean I neglet the creative and aesthetic aspects of the problems. In facts, I currently lead a data team in a creative agency and our analysis are fast, clever and great to see.

\cvparagraph{Why This Wonderful field?}
Lorem ipsum dolor sic amet

\cvparagraph{Why Me?}
Put the pieces together is my daily driver. I love helping others and find extremely useful, if not necessary, in doing so as I am a supportive teammate and a polite and inspirational team leader. I put myself with genuine enthusiasm in every problem that needs to be solved and I tapproach them with a positive attitude, scientific mindset, intelligence and soft skills. My long experience working for consulting firms and, nowdays, for the prestigious McCann creative agency let me smoothing my rough edges as technical engineer. Thus, I feel myself very confident in arguing with non-technical collegues, stakeholders, businessmen and clients with no discomfort.
