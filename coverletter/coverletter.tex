\cvparagraph{About Me}
I am an enthusiastic software engineer who loves to learn new skills, redesign the ways to obtain them and show the world what you can do with them. I own a spirited interest in technological advances and flamboyant ways in which you can create solutions based on these. I previously worked for "Philips Turkey" company, developed a full stack application to keep track of maintenance records of the medical devices using MongoDB, React, Node.js and Express.
Improved the MongoDB query performance by 20\% and redesigned the user interface to achieve an easy to use application.

\cvparagraph{Why Game Development?}
I'm looking for an organic environment with fluid teamwork and mutual cooperation in diverse areas of knowledge. Game Development draws my attention because it is willing to take risks and innovate in fields that others leave behind. I want to work in a place where my job becomes meaningful to others, a place where I can help people reach further and innovate more.

\cvparagraph{Why Me?}
 Coding it's my daily driver. I love helping others and find extremely necessary in doing so. I have designed and implemented an educational web based parametric game against phishing attacks using Unity for the game development, used Node.js for the backend part and Koa as a web framework connected to a PostgreSQL database. Coordinated with two group members while developing the graduation project.
